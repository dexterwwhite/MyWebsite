    <h2>Aggie Miracle</h2>
	<p>This past year, I have had the pleasure of being a part of  
	  <a href="https://www.aggiemiracle.com/">Aggie Miracle</a>
	  , which is service based organization at Texas A&M that focuses on raising
	  as much money as possible for the McLane Children's Medical Center. This
	  organization has been my most recent and most prominent form of service, 
	  and for good reason! It is working towards a very important cause, and it 
	  really has such a positive effect on the children who are treated at McLane's
	  every year.
	</p>
  </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Seven Loaves</h2>
	<p>Although I have not been able to serve at 
	  <a href="https://www.thestorehousecc.org/seven-loaves/">Seven Loaves</a>
	  as much in recent years due to
	  living in College Station for school, in high school this organization was a place I would
	  frequent! Seven Loaves is a food pantry that serves anyone who is struggling with food in Plano,
	   Texas! Food pantries have special meaning to me as I have had family members who have relied on
	  food services, and I sincerely hope that if someone is struggling places like Seven Loaves are able
	  to get them the help they need.
	</p>
  </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>TA Position</h2>
	<p>This semester, I was actually given the honor of becoming a Teaching Assistant for Doctor 
	  <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/Carlisle-Martin.html">Martin Carlisle</a>
	  , a professor at Texas A&M University. Through this position, I am able to give back to newer
	  computer science students by sharing my knowledge with them. It is my ultimate goal to give the
	  students I teach a solid understanding of basic computer science concepts and help them grow to 
	  love computer science as much as I do.
	</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 50px;">Although less extensively, I have also spent time volunteering at many other organizations
  such as the 
  <a href="https://ntfb.org/">North Texas Food Bank</a>
  , and many more.
