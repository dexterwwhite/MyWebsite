						Nutritist is a nutrition website that I and four other group members worked on together with the 
						use of the Agile software development methodology. This web application was built with the use of 
						HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python Flask, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, our group utilized 3 different 
						APIs from Edamam in order to add functionality to many of the aspects of our website. My main 
						contributions were to the Tracking, Recipe Recommendation, and the Home pages. Additionally, a 
						large portion of my work was on the integration of our database and APIs' input and output on to 
						our user interface.

					<h2>Highly Available Distributed Social Networking Service</h2>
					<p>
						My highly available social networking service is a social networking service that is meant to never 
						go down! Consisting of 3 server clusters (that each consist of 2 servers and a synchronizer) as well 
						as a coordinator, this service is highly scalable, available, and synchronized. This project was built 
						with C++ and with the use of gRPC. Additionally, it utilizes several different distributed systems concepts 
						in order to maintain its availability and synchronization. This project was very challenging, yet 
						very rewarding due to the complexity of the concepts used.

						EyeTrain is an eye-tracking rhythm game that was made by 3 other students and I for the 
						<a href="https://tamuhack.com/th">TAMUhack</a> 
						2021 hackathon. This project was built with Python, Pygame, openCV, and dlib as well as 
						the open source gaze_tracking library. My main contributions were to the Pygame interface, 
						or more specifically the music/object interaction, collisions, and gameplay. And guess what? 
						<strong>This project won us second place at the hackathon!</strong>

						This website is also one of my personal projects! While the first iteration of my 
						personal website was actually my first attempt at using HTML in my life, what you 
						are currently looking at is a profusely updated second version. This website was 
						built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Additionally, another goal of 
						mine for this project has been to utilize the enterprise-level git practices I 
						learned at Visa, which can be seen on this project's GitHub repository!

					<h2>Content Streaming Service GUI</h2>
					<p>
						This project was meant to mimic a content streaming service, and was built by my 3 partners 
						and I using the Waterfall software development methodology. We built this project using Java, 
						Java Swing, and a PostgreSQL database. Using a table that consisted of over 20000 rows of 
						content as well as almost an equally large number of users, my team and I created algorithms 
						that would mimic the algorithms of an actual content streaming service. One of my key additions 
						was the implementation of the "Director's Choice" algorithm, which utilized several different 
						queries and functions in order to make a recommendation to a user!

					<h2>Calming Planner</h2>
					<p>
						The Calming Planner is a dementia-accessible planner mobile application that I created along 
						with 3 other partners. Our main goal for this application was making it as accessible as 
						possible to those with dementia, as well as following general accessibility guidelines 
						throughout. This mobile application was designed with React Native as well as utilized an 
						SQLite database. My role in the group was mainly focused on the database features as well as 
						initial setup.

					<h2>Accessible Collection</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout my time taking the class Accessible Computing, I was given the opportunity to work 
						on several different accessible projects. While my calming planner might have been my most 
						complex accessible project, these webpages also succeed in the field of accessibility! 
						The main goal of these webpages is to be as widely accessible as possible and to ensure 
						people with disabilities are able to experience equity when viewing these pages.

					<h2>Distributed Collection</h2>
					<p>
						To this day, my distributed systems class has been one of the most challenging classes I 
						have taken. Even though it was a hard class, the lessons I learned were irreplaceable and 
						provided me with a good look into the world of distributed systems. The main project of 
						this class was the highly available distributed SNS project, but the other projects in 
						the course are noteworthy as well. The topics of these projects include a socket-based 
						chatroom service, usage of gRPC remote procedure calls, and a Hadoop Distributed File System 
						MapReduce application.

					<h2>Miscellaneous Projects</h2>
					<p>
						I additionally have a few more smaller projects within my portfolio that do a good job of 
						emphasizing my passion for trying new technologies. I really enjoy testing out different 
						programming languages and frameworks, and these miscellaneous projects are a culmination 
						of that passion. These projects include a ReactJs and Spring Boot based social media 
						platform, a NextJs reimagining of my personal website, and a random-number based baby 
						name generator written in C++. These projects really do represent my drive to learn 
						and experience as much as possible within the realm of computer science!
