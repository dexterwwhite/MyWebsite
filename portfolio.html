      <p><h3><a href="https://devpost.com/software/eyetrain">eyeTrain</a></h3></p>
	  <p>eyeTrain is a project that I co-created with Pranav Jain, Patrick Apgar, and Austin Ramirez.
	    This project was made for the 
	    <a href="https://tamuhack.com/th">TAMUhack</a> 
	    2021 hackathon. It is essentially a rhythm game in which
	    the only way you can interact with the game is through the use of your eyes. Our mission was to
	    create a game that would help with the strain of staring at screens all day long that became much
	    more prevalent than ever due to Covid19. This goal is accomplished through the fact that playing the
	    game actually exercises your eyes, which helps with eye strain. This project was written in python, and
	    my work mainly consisted of the coding of the game interface and gameplay.

      Baby Name Generator

    <dd class="col-sm-9" style="margin-top: 20px;">
      While the idea of this was initially a joke with my girlfriend, I began to actually enjoy working on
	  this project later on! The main goal of this program is to repeatedly generate randomized baby names
	  through the use of python's randint() function to randomly add letters and create a "name". Starting
	  out, the names generated were not really "names", but as I worked on my algorithm more and more the 
	  names eventually began to mimic real names.
