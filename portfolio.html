				Nutritist is a nutrition website that I and four other group members worked on together with the 
				use of the Agile software development methodology. This web application was built with the use of 
				HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python Flask, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, our group utilized 3 different 
				APIs from Edamam in order to add functionality to many of the aspects of our website. My main 
				contributions were to the Tracking, Recipe Recommendation, and the Home pages. Additionally, a 
				large portion of my work was on the integration of our database and APIs' input and output on to 
				our user interface.

	  <p>eyeTrain is a project that I co-created with Pranav Jain, Patrick Apgar, and Austin Ramirez.
	    This project was made for the 
	    <a href="https://tamuhack.com/th">TAMUhack</a> 
	    2021 hackathon. It is essentially a rhythm game in which
	    the only way you can interact with the game is through the use of your eyes. Our mission was to
	    create a game that would help with the strain of staring at screens all day long that became much
	    more prevalent than ever due to Covid19. This goal is accomplished through the fact that playing the
	    game actually exercises your eyes, which helps with eye strain. This project was written in python, and
	    my work mainly consisted of the coding of the game interface and gameplay.
