						<h2>Fields of Interest</h2>
						<p>
							Currently, my main fields of interest in the world of computer science are software engineering and 
							web development. During my time as a software engineering intern at Visa this past summer, it was 
							very fulfilling to create a RESTful API 
							backend and then showcase data from this API on the frontend of our site. I plan on studying and 
							gaining more experience within the field of full-stack development in the future, as it has 
							really piqued my interest! When it comes to software engineering, I am equally as thrilled by the 
							prospects of this field. The process of being able to build up a solution to a problem from 
							scratch is very compelling, and it almost feels as if you are working through a puzzle while 
							coding. While these two fields are the ones that stand out the most to me at the time, there is 
							still so much more within the realm of computer science that I would love to experience. Regardless 
							of where I end up post-graduation, though, I know I will give it my very best!

						<h2>Aggie Miracle</h2>
						<p>
							Aggie Miracle is a philanthropic organization at Texas A&M that has a goal of raising funds and 
							awareness for the McLane Children's Medical Center in Temple, Texas. Aggie Miracle has been a 
							passion of mine for the past 2 years, and for my upcoming senior year I will be continuing in 
							the organization for my third year! Previously, I was a committee member in the 
							Miracle Maker Relation's committee (focuses on recruiting other students to 
							participate at our big event, AggieTHON) and in the logistics committee (focuses on providing 
							food for AggieTHON, as well as helping other committees plan/setup their work). For this 
							upcoming year, I have been selected to serve as the Director of Special Events! For this role, 
							I will be leading a group of committee members to boost awareness and support for our cause 
							through setting up special events. These events will include holidays and special days for 
							the medical center, as well as any other occasions my committee thinks up. For my third and 
							final year, I will give my all to be the best director I can be!

						<h2>Aggie Web Developers</h2>
						<p>
							My interest in web development definitely began to really manifest during my junior year. During 
							this time, I was working on web development projects in several of my classes as well as spending 
							time participating the Aggie Web Developers club. The focus of this club was to share web 
							development knowledge and experience with its members, and each weekly meeting would involve 
							a new tool/framework and us practicing using it. Some examples of meeting topics were ReactJS, 
							SQL Databases, and Postman. Additionally, an example of one of the projects I made within this 
							club was a URL-shortener website. Overall, it was very fun to take part in this club and it 
							really helped drive my passion for web development even further!

						<h2>Table Tennis</h2>
						<p>
							A new hobby of mine that I picked up during my time at Visa is table tennis! What started as 
							a fun break-time activity once or twice a week turned into something I would play every day 
							at lunch as well as after work. Even though I had played table tennis a few times as a kid, 
							being able to play so frequently with the other interns and employees at Visa led me to 
							really developing a passion for the sport. Due to how much I have been enjoying it, I also 
							plan to join the table tennis club at Texas A&M!
