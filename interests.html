					<h2>Fields of Interest</h2>
					<p>
						Currently, my main fields of interest in the world of computer science are software engineering and 
						web development. During my time as a software engineering intern at Visa this past summer, I 
						really enjoyed working on my full-stack project. It was very fulfilling to create a RESTful API 
						backend and then showcase data from this API on the frontend of our site. I plan on studying and 
						gaining more experience within the field of full-stack development in the future, as it has 
						really piqued my interest! Additionally, software engineering as a whole really intrigues me, 
						and I will continue to work hard at becoming one post-graduation!

					<h2>Aggie Miracle</h2>
					<p>
						Aggie Miracle is a philanthropic organization at Texas A&M that has a goal of raising funds and 
						awareness for the McLane Children's Medical Center in Temple, Texas. Aggie Miracle has been a 
						passion of mine for the past 2 years, and for my upcoming senior year I will be continuing in 
						the organization for my third year! For the past 2 years I was a committee member in the 
						Miracle Maker Relation's committee (which has a focus on recruiting other students to come and 
						participate at our big event, AggieTHON) and in the logistics committee (focuses on providing 
						food for AggieTHON, as well as helping other committees plan/setup their work). For this 
						upcoming year, I plan on applying for a director role, meaning I will lead my own committee 
						for the year. After being in the organization for so long, it is only fitting that I would 
						move into a leadership role in order to lead and share my passion with a group of newer 
						members.

					<h2>Aggie Web Developers</h2>
					<p>
						My interest in web development definitely began to really manifest during my junior year. During 
						this time, I was working on web development projects in several of my classes as well as spending 
						time participating the Aggie Web Developers club. The focus of this club was to share web 
						development knowledge and experience with its members, and each weekly meeting would involve 
						a new tool/framework and us practicing using it. Some examples of meeting topics were ReactJS, 
						SQL Databases, and Postman. Additionally, an example of one of the projects I made within this 
						club was a URL-shortener website. Overall, it was very fun to take part in this club and it 
						really helped drive my passion for web development even further!

					<h2>Table Tennis</h2>
					<p>
						A new hobby of mine that I picked up during my time at Visa is table tennis! What started as 
						a fun break-time activity once or twice a week turned into something I would play every day 
						at lunch as well as after work. Even though I had played table tennis a few times as a kid, 
						being able to play so frequently with the other interns and employees at Visa led me to 
						really developing a passion for the sport. Due to how much I have been enjoying it, I also 
						plan to try and join a table tennis club at Texas A&M!
