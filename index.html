					Hello! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterwwhite/">Dexter White</a> and I am a 
					senior computer science major currently attending Texas A&M university! I am also pursuing a minor 
					in cybersecurity as well. If I had to describe myself in only three words, I would definitely 
					choose the adjectives: positive, driven, and comedic.
				</p>
				<p>
					It feels like I have been interested in computer science for my whole life, but this field really 
					became more than a hobby in my junior year of highschool when I took my first computer science class. 
					Working with Java and learning the basics of computer science really captivated me and made me 
					realize just how interesting programming and the broader field of computer science was. Since then, 
					I have gotten so much more exciting and valuable experience during my time as both a computer science 
					major at Texas A&M as well as a software engineering intern at Visa!
				</p>
				<p>
					Some more facts about me are that I don't keep my passion for computer science limited to solely what 
					I learn in the classroom! I am always trying to find ways to learn and try new concepts and technologies, 
					as well as share my knowledge with others. One way I have achieved this is through my position as 
					a teaching assistant under Dr. Martin Carlisle, a professor of practice at Texas A&M. Working as a 
					teaching assistant not only allows me to reinforce my knowledge of past computer science topics I 
					have learned, but it also allows me to share my love of the field with other, younger students! 
					Additionally, I really enjoy working on personal projects as well as attending hackathons in my 
					spare time. A little fun fact is that my team and I actually won second place at the 2021 
					TAMUhack hackathon!
				</p>
				<p>
					Another characteristic I would describe for myself is that I am a person who thrives in a 
					team environment. I really enjoy working on group projects as these not only allow me to 
					create projects on a scale that would be much harder to achieve on my own, but they also 
					allow me to learn from my other team members. While I do pride myself on my knowledge of a 
					areas within computer science, there are always those that know more than me and it is a 
					great privilege to be able to learn from them! Also, when I am working with a team, it 
					is always a top priority of mine to make sure our team is as efficient and as effective as 
					possible. This means that if needed, I will step up to take charge of the team but at the 
					same time I am completely willing to be delegated tasks if someone else takes the reins. 
					Officially, though, I simply like talking to people and working in a team is a great excuse 
					for that!
