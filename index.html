	    <p class="my-2">Hello! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterwwhite/">Dexter White</a> 
	      and I am a junior computer science major currently attending Texas A&M university! If I 
		  had to describe myself in only three words, I would definitely choose the adjectives: 
	      positive, driven, and comedic.
	    </p>
	    <p>With the introduction of Covid into our lives a year and a half ago, life changed drastically.
	      It brought about many negative emotions and it would seem like there was a constant negative haze 
	      surrounding every aspect of life. Surprisingly, this led to me entering a new, very positive phase 
		  of my life. I began eating healthier meals, I tried to get the correct amount of sleep each night, 
		  I began lifting weights and running 2-3 times a week, and I began to implement aspects of stoicism 
		  into my life.
	    </p>
	    <p>After about a year and a half, I have never felt better! Most days I wake up very excited to take 
	      on the day and push myself as hard as I can. My past view of the world has completely changed, and 
		  I am constantly admiring how much my outlook has improved since then. I also try to spread my 
		  happiness with others as much as possible, whether it is through supporting them in their endeavors
		  or attempting to make them laugh with cheesy jokes (I view them as funny, though, which is the most 
		  important part!).
	    </p>
	    <p>I don't mean to come off as conceited, but I am definitely someone I would like to have as a team 
	      member. Having dealt with very bad teammates on numerous occasions, I try my best to act opposite to 
		  these poor teammates. It is always my goal to be accountable and hardworking, so when I am delegated 
		  work it becomes my mission to complete it to the best of my ability. I am also very agreeable, so you 
		  should not have to worry about getting into an argument with me over the logistics of a project. As a 
		  positive, agreeable, and hardworking person, I believe I would fit very well into any team.
	    </p>
