	    <p class="my-2">Hello! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dexterwwhite/">Dexter White</a> 
	      and I am a junior computer science major currently attending Texas A&M university! I am also pursuing 
		  a minor in cybersecurity as well! If I had to describe myself in only three words, I would definitely 
		  choose the adjectives: positive, driven, and comedic.
		<p>
			It feels like I have been interested in computer science for my whole life, but this field really 
			became more than a hobby in my junior year of highschool when I took my first computer science class. 
			Working with Java and learning the basics of computer science really captivated me and made me 
			realize just how interesting programming and the broader field of computer science was. Since then, 
			I have gotten so much more exciting and valuable experience during my time as a computer science 
			major at Texas A&M!
		</p>
	    <p>
			Some more facts about me are that I don't keep my passion for computer science limited to solely what 
			I learn in the classroom! I am always trying to find ways to learn and try new concepts and technologies, 
			as well as share my knowledge with others. One way I have achieved this is through my position as 
			a teaching assistant under Dr. Martin Carlisle, a professor of practice at Texas A&M. Working as a 
			teaching assistant not only allows me to reinforce my knowledge of past computer science topics I 
			have learned, but it also allows me to share my love of the field with other, younger students! 
			Additionally, I really enjoy working on personal projects as well as attending hackathons in my 
			spare time. A little fun fact is that my team and I actually won second place at the 2021 
			TAMUhack hackathon!
	    </p>
	    <p>
			I would also describe myself as hardworking as well as someone who thrives in a team environment. 
			I really enjoy working on group projects as these not only allow me to create projects on a 
			scale that would be much harder to achieve on my own, but they also allow me to learn from my 
			other team members. While I do pride myself on my knowledge of a areas within computer science, 
			there are always those that know more than me and it is a great privilege to be able to learn from 
			them! This is a main part of the reason that I strongly desire the opportunity to work as a software 
			engineering intern. I do currently have a summer 2022 software engineering internship with Visa, 
			and I am very excited to get enterprise-level experience as well as work with the many  
			brilliant minds there. Additionally, I am also looking for potential Fall 2022 and/or Spring 2023 
			software engineering internship opportunities for these same reasons. The prospect of being 
			given the opportunity to get actual on the job experience and learn from those that are smarter 
			than me is invaluable, and I would really love to have the chance to do this!
