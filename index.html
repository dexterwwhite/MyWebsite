					<p class="home-page-card-body">
						Hello! My name is Dexter White and I am a senior computer science major currently attending Texas 
						A&M University. I am also pursuing a minor in cybersecurity as well! It feels like I have been 
						interested in computer science for my whole life, but this field really became more than a hobby 
						in my junior year of highschool when I took my first computer science class. Since then, I have 
						gotten so much more exciting and valuable experience during my time as both a computer science 
						major at Texas A&M as well as a software engineering intern at Visa!
					</p>
					<p class="home-page-card-body">
						A bit more about me is that I don't keep my passion for computer science limited to solely what 
						I learn in the classroom. I am always trying to find ways to learn and try new concepts and technologies, 
						as well as share my knowledge with others! One way I have achieved this is through my position as 
						a teaching assistant under Dr. Martin Carlisle, a professor of practice at Texas A&M. Working as a 
						teaching assistant not only allows me to reinforce my knowledge of past computer science topics I 
						have learned, but it also allows me to share my love of the field with other, newer students! 
						Additionally, I really enjoy working on personal projects as well as attending hackathons in my 
						spare time. A little fun fact is that my team and I actually won second place at the 2021 
						TAMUhack hackathon!
