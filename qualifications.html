					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Over the years, I have been able to learn and develop a wide variety of skills within the field of computer 
						science. When it comes to programming languages, I feel most comfortable when using C++, Java, and Python! 
						I also have worked a considerable amount with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL throughout my time as a student 
						and intern. In the realm of frameworks and databases, I have experience with ReactJS, Java Spring Boot, 
						Python Flask, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. Finally, some additional tools and techonologies I am 
						confident with using are Git, Unix, AWS, gRPC, and Node.js. My skills are not only technical, though, as I 
						am proficient at team collaboration, communication, and adaptibility as well!

					<h2>Experience</h2>
					<div>
						<h3>Visa Software Engineering Intern -- Summer 2022</h3>
						<p>
							It is hard to put into words how much I have learned and how much I have grown as a software engineer 
							throughout my time at Visa. To begin with, my main project for the summer involved creating a Dependency 
							Mapping Service for over 130 internal applications as well as utilizing this service within the UI of an 
							internal website. I approached this challenge by creating a service that consisted of a new database 
							table, a Spring Boot service, and a Spring Boot RESTful API endpoint. My service replaced functions that 
							would take over a minute to compute with functions that would take under a second to compute. On our 
							internal website (built with ReactJS), I utilized Redux in order to display the dependency mapping and 
							accountability information. This project had been an existing problem for the team I worked with, so my 
							work was directly useful to the team and the company as a whole! Throughout my time there, my team used 
							the Agile software development methodology which meant I was able to get first-hand experience with using 
							Agile at an enterprise level. Additionally, I was taught and utilized enterprise-level git practices, 
							which was very beneficial when it came to working within my team. One last point to bring up is that I 
							worked with 3 other interns throughout the summer which taught me a lot about planning, sharing of work, 
							and team collaboration. Overall, I learned so much and was able to build up an invaluable amount of 
							experience as a software engineer, and I know I will use what this internship has taught me throughout 
							the rest of my career.

						<h3>Teaching Assistant -- Fall 2021 to present</h3>
						<p>
							Since the fall of my Junior year, I have been a TA under Dr. Martin Carlisle. In that very first semester, 
							I held this position for the class Introduction to Program Design and Concepts. The responsibilities for 
							this class involved running a lab section, holding office hours, and grading. Each week during lab I would 
							lead a class of 30 students through a programming assignment, all the while helping out and answering any 
							students' questions. I would also hold several hours of office hours each week that were typically very 
							busy (back-to-back students for the entire duration!). These office hours would consist of helping students 
							identify bugs in their weekly programming assignment as well as teaching them debugging strategies and other 
							coding best practices. For the spring of 2022 and this upcoming fall of 2022, I was and will continue to be 
							a teaching assistant for the class Discrete Structures. This position involves a slight shift in 
							responsibilities from the previous class to mainly office hours and grading. The office hours for this class 
							typically consist of me sharing my knowledge of discrete math topics and working students through problems 
							related to these topics. Overall, being a teaching assistant has helped me grow an incredible amount as a 
							computer science student. Not only has it helped reinforce my knowledge of the introductory computer science 
							topics, it has also taught me how to share this knowledge with others and instill problem solving strategies 
							within my students.
