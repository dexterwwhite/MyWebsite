			<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>
				Over the years, I have been able to learn and develop a wide variety of skills within the field of 
				computer science. When it comes to programming languages, I feel most comfortable when using C++, 
				Java, and Python! I also have worked a good amount with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL throughout 
				my time as a student and intern. For frameworks and databases, I have experience with ReactJS, 
				Java Spring Boot, Python Flask, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. Finally, some additional 
				tools and techonologies I am confident with using are Git, Unix, AWS, gRPC, and Node.js. My skills 
				are not only technical, though, as I am proficient at team collaboration, communication, and 
				adaptibility as well!

			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Visa Software Engineering Intern -- Summer 2022</h3>
				<p>
					It is hard to put into words how much I have learned and how much I have grown as a software 
					engineer throughout my time at Visa. My main project for the summer involved creating a 
					Dependency Mapping Service for over 130 internal applications as well as utilizing this 
					service within the UI of an internal website. My service consisted of a new database table, 
					a Spring Boot service, as well as a Spring Boot RESTful API endpoint. My service replaced 
					functions that relied on API calls that would take over a minute to compute with functions 
					that would take under a second to compute. On our internal website (built with ReactJS), I 
					utilized Redux in order to display the dependency and accountability information. This 
					project had been an existing problem for the team I worked with, so my work was directly 
					useful to the team and the company as a whole! My team used the Agile software development 
					methodology which meant I was able to get first-hand experience with using Agile at an 
					enterprise level. Additionally, I was taught and utilized enterprise-level git practices, 
					which are definitely also important to know. Finally, I worked with 3 other interns 
					throughout the summer which taught me a lot about planning and the sharing of work. Overall, 
					I learned so much and was able to build up an invaluable amount of experience as a software 
					engineer, and I know I will use what this internship has taught me throughout the rest of 
					my career.

				<h3>Teaching Assistant -- Fall 2021 to present</h3>
				<p>
					Since Fall of my Junior year, I have been a TA under Dr. Martin Carlisle. In the fall of 2021, 
					I held this position for the class Introduction to Program Design and Concepts. The 
					responsibilities for this class involved a lab section, office hours, and grading. During lab 
					I would lead a class of 30 other students through a programming assignment each week, all the 
					while helping out and answering any questions along the way. I would also hold several hours 
					of office hours each week that were typically very busy with back-to-back students for the 
					entire duration. These office hours would consist of helping students identify bugs in their 
					weekly programming assignment as well as teaching them debugging strategies and other coding 
					best practices. For the spring of 2022 and this upcoming fall of 2022, I was and will continue 
					to be a teaching assistant for the class Discrete Structures. This position involved a slight 
					shift in responsibilities which are mainly office hours and grading. The office hours for this 
					class mainly involve me sharing my knowledge of discrete math topics and working students 
					through problems related to these topics. Overall, being a teaching assistant helped me grow 
					an incredible amount as a computer science student. Not only has it helped reinforce the 
					introductory computer science topics, it has also taught me how to share this knowledge with 
					others and help instill problem solving strategies within my students.
