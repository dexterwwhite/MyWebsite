    <p>My main technical areas of interest are currently software engineering, web development, and cybersecurity.
	   I am currently looking to greatly increase my knowledge in these fields, and I plan on utilizing several opportunities
	   over the next few years. I have recently become a member of the 
	   <a href="https://www.aggiedevelopers.com/">Aggie Web Developers </a>
	   in order to get an in-depth look at web development, as well as I have signed up to take several 
	   cybersecurity classes over my next few semesters at Texas A&M.</p>

  <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Experience</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">While these may not have given me technical experience, I have held two jobs in the
                       past few years that have greatly increased my communication skills. I worked at both
					   the concession stand at
					   <a href="http://www.psaplano.org/">Plano Sports Authority</a>
					   as well as at 
					   <a href="https://vitalitybowls.com/">Vitality Bowls.</a>
					   These two jobs had me intereacting with customers on numerous occasions and have given
					   me a large amount of experience with interpersonal communication in a job setting.</dd>
