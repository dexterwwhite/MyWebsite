    <p>
		Over the years, the languages I have worked with are C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Haskell!
		Additionally, I have also worked with technologies such as Git, Unix, Sockets, Python Flask, PostgreSQL, ReactJS, 
		Django, Django REST Framework, AWS Cloud9, gRPC, and Node.js. Additionally, throughout my time at A&M I have also 
		gotten the privilege of working on a few projects with the Agile and Waterfall software development 
		methodologies. For my Microsoft and/or typesetting needs, I also have a large amount of experience with Word, Excel, 
		and LaTeX. Finally, some of my non-technical skills include team collaboration, drive, communication, and desire 
		to grow as much as I can as a person!

  <dd class="col-sm-9">
	  While these may not have given me technical experience, I have held two jobs in the
      past few years that have greatly increased my communication skills. I worked at both
	  the concession stand at
	  <a href="http://www.psaplano.org/">Plano Sports Authority</a>
	  as well as at 
	  <a href="https://vitalitybowls.com/">Vitality Bowls.</a>
	  These two jobs had me intereacting with customers on numerous occasions and have given
	  me a large amount of experience with interpersonal communication in a job setting.
